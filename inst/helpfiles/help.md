**Where is help located**

Each tab has its own help information which can be accessed by clicking on the question mark circle at the top of the instruction box of the tab. 

**Please fix the following issue..**

The app will give informative error and help messages to guide you through the process. 
If a box pops up saying 'Please fix the following issue..' read the message to understand the instructions provided. 
This may include making changes to the data and uploading it again. 
When this box pops up you must rectify the issue to continue.

**App is not working**

If it appears the app has frozen or is not responding try restarting your browser. 
Different browser may display information differently, try a different browser if the app is not working. R shiny applications can take some time to generate results, ensure you have waited enough time before restarting.
