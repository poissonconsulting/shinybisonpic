#### Plot Data Help

Explore the ratios of various sex-age groups by selecting any combinations of values.
The ratio that is plotted is numerator:(denominator + numerator) to avoid issues with undefined or infinite values when numerator or denominator equals zero.

For the plot to appear, you must:

- select at least one value for the **Numerator** 
- select at least one value for the **Denominator**

The plot can be downloaded as a .png file by pressing the **Download Plot** button on the top right of the Plots box.  

##### Example 

To view a plot of female calves against all calves:

- In the **Numerator** tick female calf.
- In the **Denominator** tick male calf, female calf and unknown calf.
