#### Plot Data Help

Explore the ratios of various sex-age groups by selecting any combinations of values.

For the plot to appear, you must:

- Select at least one value for the **Numerator**.
- Select at least one value for the **Denominator**.

The plot can be downloaded as a .png file by pressing the **Download Plot** button on the top right of the Plots box.  

Note that a ratio value of "Inf" (infinity) indicates that the group in a particular camera trap event has no individuals in the denominator class.
For example, if plotting the calf:cow ratio, a ratio value of "Inf" would represent an event with one or more calves and no cows.
Similarly, a ratio of "0" indicates that the ratio in a particular camera trap event has no individuals in the numerator class.

##### Example 

To view a plot of female calves against all calves:

- In the **Numerator** tick female calf.
- In the **Denominator** tick male calf, female calf, and unknown calf.
