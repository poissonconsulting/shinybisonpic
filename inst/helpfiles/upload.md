#### Upload Data Help

Get raw data into the app by filling out the template and uploading the file. The uploaded data will be run through a series of checks before it will be accepted by the app.

##### Process

1. Download and fill in template. 
   - Click the **Download Template** button
   - Find the excel file (template-bison.xlsx) on your computer
   - Enter the data into the file
   - Review data to ensure it follows the required data format
2. Upload data.
   - Click the **Browse...** button and select a file
   - If the file is successfully uploaded it will appear in the Uploaded data box
   - If the file is not successfully uploaded a pop up box will appear with an error message
     - Close the pop up box
     - Correct error
     - Upload corrected data
     - Repeat until file is successfully uploaded
   
##### Required Data Format

The Required data format box at the top right of the page contains the checks and rules the data is run through when uploaded. 
The data will not be uploaded to the app until the required data format is followed.
The app is only able to check one error at a time so this process may take several iterations as you work through various issues in the data format. 

Helpful tips:

- download the template and copy your data to the template file 
- words must be identical this includes sheet names, column names and cell values (ie they are case sensitive and space sensitive)
