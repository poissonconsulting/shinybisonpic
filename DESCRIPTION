Description: This app is a wrapper on the `bisonpictools` R package which 
    provides non R user's a way to visualize and clean wood bison camera
    trap data. Camera trap data is uploaded and then visualized spatially by
    viewing the locations on a map and being able to explore the ratios between
    different combinations of sex and life stages. A cleaned and processed data 
    set that is ready for modeling can be downloaded from the app.
